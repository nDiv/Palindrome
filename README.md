# Palindrome
A package for playing around with Palindromic integers.

The current Python version of sumPalindrome takes about 23.6 hours on my Windows machine and 12 hours on my Linux machine, for an input of 10^12. The answer is 495576157738819851. We can do much better than this. This code needs to be optimized.

The current Matlab version of sumPalindrome takes about 44 minutes on my Windows machine and about 34 minutes on my Linux machine, for the same input of 10^12, but outputs a wrong answer: 495576157731179456. This code needs to debugged.
Looping from 1 to 10^12 while doing nothing inside the loops in Matlab on my coreI7 Windows 8 machine takes about 34.2 minutes.
